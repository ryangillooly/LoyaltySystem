# Loyalty System: Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan, technical design, and next steps for the loyalty system project.

## 1. Technical Design Specification

### 1.1 API Specification
- Create OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
- Define request/response models for each operation
- Design authentication/authorization requirements per endpoint
- Establish rate limiting and security policies

### 1.2 Database Schema Design
- Finalize table definitions with all columns and data types
- Define indexes for performance optimization
- Plan database partitioning strategy for high-volume tables (Transactions)
- Design data migration strategy

### 1.3 Infrastructure Architecture
- Detail AWS resource requirements (Lambda functions, API Gateway, RDS/DynamoDB sizing)
- Design event flow using EventBridge/SQS/SNS
- Define CloudFormation/Terraform templates
- Plan monitoring and observability approach

## 2. Development Environment Setup

### 2.1 Project Structure
- Create solution with appropriate projects/modules
- Set up shared libraries for domain models and common utilities
- Configure development tools (linting, formatting, etc.)

### 2.2 CI/CD Pipeline
- Set up build and test automation
- Configure deployment pipelines for each environment
- Implement infrastructure-as-code deployment

### 2.3 Local Development
- Docker-compose setup for local dependencies
- Mock services for third-party integrations
- Development database with seed data

## 3. Core Implementation (Vertical Slice)

### 3.1 Implement Core Domain Model
- LoyaltyProgram, LoyaltyCard, and Transaction entities
- Domain services for business logic
- Repository interfaces for data access

### 3.2 Create Data Access Layer
- Implement repositories
- Set up database context and ORM mappings
- Create data migration scripts

### 3.3 Build API Endpoints for Key Flows
- Focus on implementing the stamp issuance flow first
- Add reward redemption functionality
- Include customer enrollment/card creation

### 3.4 Implement Event Publishing
- Set up event dispatchers
- Configure AWS EventBridge/SQS integration
- Implement event handlers for key events

## 4. Front-End Development

### 4.1 Merchant Dashboard (Admin Web App)
- Authentication and user management
- Brand and store management screens
- Loyalty program configuration
- Reporting and analytics dashboard

### 4.2 Merchant Companion App (Staff Mobile/Tablet)
- QR code scanning functionality
- Customer lookup
- Stamp issuance and reward redemption screens
- Store-level reporting

### 4.3 Customer Portal (Web/Mobile)
- Customer registration and profile
- Loyalty card display with progress visualization
- Transaction history
- Available rewards and redemption options

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1 Unit Tests
- Test domain models and business logic
- Repository and service tests
- Focus on core invariants and business rules

### 5.2 Integration Tests
- API endpoint tests
- Database integration tests
- Event processing tests

### 5.3 End-to-End Tests
- Key user flows across all applications
- Performance and load testing

### 5.4 Security Testing
- Penetration testing
- Authentication and authorization tests
- PII/data protection compliance

## 6. Infrastructure and Deployment

### 6.1 AWS Environment Setup
- Provision dev/test/staging/production environments
- Set up networking, security groups, IAM roles
- Configure monitoring and alerting

### 6.2 Database Setup
- Create RDS instances
- Configure DynamoDB tables and capacity
- Set up backup and recovery procedures

### 6.3 Deployment Automation
- Implement blue/green or canary deployment strategies
- Configure automated rollbacks
- Set up log aggregation and monitoring

## 7. Documentation and Training

### 7.1 System Documentation
- Architecture documentation
- API documentation
- Database schema documentation

### 7.2 User Documentation
- Admin user guides
- Staff training materials
- Customer FAQs

### 7.3 Operations Documentation
- Monitoring and alerting procedures
- Backup and recovery
- Incident response

## 8. Recommended First Steps (Next 2-4 Weeks)

To get the project moving efficiently, focus on these immediate next steps:

### 8.1 Create Project Repository
- Set up the basic solution structure
- Configure build and CI/CD pipelines
- Implement core domain models

### 8.2 Build a Proof-of-Concept for Key Components
- Implement the LoyaltyCard and Transaction domain models
- Create a simple API for stamp issuance
- Implement basic QR code generation/scanning

### 8.3 Infrastructure as Code
- Define CloudFormation/Terraform templates for core AWS resources
- Set up development environment
- Create database migration scripts

### 8.4 Vertical Slice Implementation
- Complete one full user journey (stamp issuance)
- Include all layers from UI to database
- Deploy to development environment for testing

By focusing on these initial steps, you'll validate the core architecture and domain model while creating a foundation that can be incrementally expanded to include all required features.
